# Sign-Language-Interpretor

The Sign Language Interpreter project enhances communication between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who use spoken language. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, this project predicts letters from images or webcam input, offering an intuitive interface. Streamlit ensures a seamless frontend experience, while Python, FastAPI, and Jupyter Notebook form the robust backend. This initiative promotes inclusivity and exemplifies the integration of innovative machine learning techniques with user-centric design.
